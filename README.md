# Collections-as-Data Notebooks

A WORK-IN-PROGRESS curated list of awesome Jupyter notebooks for querying and analyzing library collections as data. Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. [Collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/) is a movement to mediate library collections in computational formats. Jupyter Notebooks provide an ideal way to introduce data-based explorations of library collections. Much of this work occurs under the umbrella of [GLAMLabs](https://glamlabs.io/).

Inspired by lists like [Awesome Jupyter: A Curated List](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter), this repo will pull together Collections as Data notebooks available on other Github repos, Binders, etc. There was a previous attempt at such a repo, a few years ago: [Awesome Jupyter Glam](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/awesome-jupyter-glam). Relevant resources from the GLAM repo have been added to this list.

For an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks for digital methods in GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, and Museums), see the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/getting-started/). The GLAM Workbench is the most exhaustive collection of Collections as Data Notebooks currently available. Mostly based off of materials in Australia and New Zealand National Libraries, their [Github repo](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench) is the easiest way to access their notebooks directly. All operational notebooks from the site will be added to this list.

# Metadata

[British Library's Notebooks](https://github.com/BL-Labs/Jupyter-notebooks-projects-using-BL-Sources) - A wide-array of notebooks for querying British Library catalog records 

[Zenodo Rest API](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/awesome-jupyter-glam/blob/master/notebooks-guides/Zenodo_API_Notebook.ipynb) - Basic Python Notebook for querying the Zenodo API 

[Libcrowds Notebooks](https://github.com/LibCrowds/notebooks/tree/master/notebooks) - Notebooks for analyzing LibCrowds data

# Text

Textual data is readily available for public domain materials through various digital collections' APIS such as HathiTrust or the National Library of Scotland. 

[National Library of Scotland Text Mining Notebooks](https://data.nls.uk/tools/jupyter-notebooks/) - A half dozen notebooks for text mining corpora produced from the National Library of Scotland's collections. 

[HTRC Feature Reader](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/tree/master/examples) - The HathiTrust Research Center's Feature reader for parsing HathiTrust's collections as extracted features of page-level parts-of-speech and word frequencies across any given HathiTrust collection.

# Images

IIIF (International Image Interoerability Framework) standardizes the library curation of digital images, making scripts composed for querying IIIF data relatively easy to adapt to different digital collections

[Smithsonian IIIF Notebooks](https://github.com/hibernator11/notebook-iiif-images) - Three separate notebooks for querying IIIF manifests, downloading images, and applying rudimentary facial recognition algorithms. 

[Library of Congress Notebooks](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration) - Includes notebooks for quantifying collections and working with IIIF images

# Spatial

[Digital Archaeology](https://electricarchaeology.ca/2018/08/21/jupyter-notebooks-for-digital-archaeology-and-history-too/) - A set of Jupyter Notebooks by Shawn Graham focused on digital archaeology methods, including accessing the Chronicling America API
